**Notes**: I was struggling with getting my Navbar to do what I wanted it to do. I used Claude AI to figure out my problem. I laid out my problem and how I wanted it to function, I then gave it the sippets of code that were tied to the navbar. It pointed out that my CSS had a height issue and how it could be fixed.
